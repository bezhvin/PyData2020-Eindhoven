# PyData2020-Eindhoven
This repository includes the codes for the my talk at [PyData Eindhoven 2020](https://eindhoven.pydata.org/): **The industrial challenge of missing data**. 
The talk is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4CtBKrp59w&t=839s), and the slides are [here](https://github.com/bezhvin/PyData2020-Eindhoven/blob/main/PyData_missingdata.pdf).

## Description 
Two practical notebooks ready to run in colab are available to practice missing data imputation. 


The notebook "[PyData_missingdata.ipynb](https://github.com/bezhvin/PyData2020-Eindhoven/blob/main/PyData_missingdata.ipynb)" includes some imputation examples as shown and explained in the talk. It may get extended with new methodologies, stay tuned!

The notebook "[PyData_GAIN.ipynb](https://github.com/bezhvin/PyData2020-Eindhoven/blob/main/PyData_GAIN.ipynb)" is the implementation of [GAIN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02920) with kersa and Tensorflow 2.x. Noting that another different implementation of this is available [here](https://github.com/jsyoon0823/GAIN)
